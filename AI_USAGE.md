# AI Usage Statement

This project was developed primarily by the author.

AI-based tools (specifically large language models) were used strictly in a supportive and assistive role during the development process. Their use was limited to the following tasks:

- Debugging and resolving syntax or runtime errors in Python code  
- Refactoring and polishing existing code for clarity, structure, and readability  
- Improving documentation, comments, and formatting to ensure consistency and ease of grading  
- Assisting with LaTeX formatting and overall report structure  

All core components of the project, including data preprocessing, model design, experimental setup, evaluation strategy, and interpretation of results, were designed, implemented, and validated by the author.

No AI tool was used to generate data, fabricate results, automate experiments, or make substantive analytical decisions. The author takes full responsibility for the correctness, originality, and integrity of the submitted code and report.
